# Visual-Control-of-Robotic-Arm
This project explores visual servoing control for a mobile manipulator system, where a 4-DOF robotic arm is mounted on an omnidirectional mobile platform. An eye-to-hand vision setup is used to guide manipulation tasks, with control strategies first developed and tested in a simulated environment.
